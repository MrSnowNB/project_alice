2. **Execute Refined Search**: Use the `search_the_web` tool with the refined query.

3. **Evaluate Search Results**: Check if the search returns valid URLs this time.

4. **Extract Information**: If valid results are returned, extract the relevant information about the CEO from the search results.

5. **Store in Long-Term Memory**: Add the extracted information to your long-term memory.

6. **Retrieve and Report**: Retrieve the stored information from memory and report it as the final answer.
