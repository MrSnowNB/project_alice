# Refactoring Plan v1: Resolving the Web Search Loop

## 1. Problem Summary

Based on the analysis in `logs.md`, the agent is stuck in an infinite loop, which manifests as a `GraphRecursionError`. This loop is caused by a persistent `TypeError` within the `search_the_web` tool.

*   **Primary Error:** `TypeError: search() got an unexpected keyword argument 'stop'` (or a similar parameter mismatch).
*   **Secondary Error:** `langgraph.errors.GraphRecursionError: Recursion limit of 25 reached...`

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

The `googlesearch` library used in `tools.py` is being called with an incorrect keyword argument to limit search results. The code currently uses `num_results=1`, but the installed version of the library expects `stop=1`. This mismatch causes the tool to fail on every execution attempt.

The agent's error handler, while functional, is not preventing the loop because the agent's plan continuously instructs it to retry the failing step.

## 3. Action Plan

To resolve this, we will correct the tool's implementation.

1.  **Modify `c:\Users\marks\Documents\Alice\src\tools.py`:**
    *   Locate the `search_the_web` function.
    *   Change the line `url = next(search(query, num_results=1))` to `url = next(search(query, stop=1))`.

## 4. Expected Outcome

Correcting the parameter in the `search_the_web` tool will fix the `TypeError`. This will allow the tool to execute successfully, breaking the failure loop and resolving the `GraphRecursionError`. The agent will then be able to proceed with its plan to find a solution for PDF to text conversion.
