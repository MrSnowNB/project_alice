# AI First: Architectural Principles for Project Alice

## Introduction
Project Alice is an open, local-first AI agent system built to execute complex tasks with self-correction, long-term memory, and dynamic extensibility. The "AI First" philosophy places artificial intelligence—not as an add-on, but as the central driver—of design decisions. This ensures the system is resilient, efficient, and adaptable, particularly for local hardware like an RTX 3090 or 36GB MacBook Pro. As a CS teacher in an urban high school, this approach emphasizes teachable concepts: How to build AI systems that are modular, error-tolerant, and future-proof, empowering students to create rather than consume technology.

This document outlines the core tenets, implementation guidelines, and benefits of AI First, drawing from Project Alice's evolution.

## Core Tenets of AI First

### 1. Separation of Concerns
AI excels at reasoning, planning, and adaptation, while traditional code handles deterministic logic, state management, and efficiency. 
- **AI Role**: Orchestrates workflows (e.g., via LLM in planning nodes) and handles ambiguity (e.g., error analysis, tool creation).
- **Code Role**: Enforces guards (e.g., circuit breakers), manages data (e.g., state pruning), and optimizes (e.g., lazy tool loading).
- **Why It Matters**: Prevents "AI overload"—e.g., don't make the LLM parse files; use Python for that. This reduces compute on local systems and avoids context bloat.

| Aspect          | AI Handles                  | Code Handles                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Planning       | Generates step-by-step plans based on goals and history. | Executes the graph (LangGraph). |
| Error Recovery | Analyzes failures and replans. | Classifies errors and triggers escalation. |
| Tool Management| Decides tool calls and creations. | Loads and filters tools via manifests. |

### 2. Resilience over Perfection
Assume errors are inevitable (e.g., API failures in logs); design for graceful handling rather than prevention.
- **Key Mechanisms**: Circuit breakers (e.g., max replan attempts), error classification (e.g., HTTP codes), and human escalation.
- **AI Integration**: LLMs analyze patterns in `failed_actions` to adapt plans dynamically.
- **Local Benefits**: On hardware like your RTX 3090, this minimizes VRAM spikes from loops—e.g., prune messages to keep context under 4K tokens.
- **Teaching Angle**: Mirrors real-world debugging: "Failures are data—use them to iterate."

### 3. Modularity and Runtime Extensibility
Break systems into independent components (e.g., sub-agents like Memory) that can evolve without rebuilding.
- **Dynamic Tools**: Agents create tools on-the-fly (e.g., search for code snippets, write to `generated_tools/`).
- **Hybrid Metadata Management**: Use YAML frontmatter in tool files for embedded details (e.g., tags, version) + a central manifest.json for quick, efficient loading.
  - **Why Hybrid?**: Frontmatter ensures portability (AI can parse individual files semantically); manifest optimizes local compute (single-file scan for lazy loading).
- **Efficiency for Local Runs**: Filter tools by plan relevance—e.g., no loading for "hi"—saving I/O and memory.
- **Forward Compatibility**: Metadata makes tools AI-ready (e.g., vector-index descriptions for semantic search).

Example YAML Frontmatter in a Tool File:
```
---
name: get_weather_free_api
description: Fetches weather without keys using public sources.
version: 1.0
tags: [weather, api, free]
last_used: 2025-07-10
---
# Tool code follows...
```

### 4. Forward Compatibility and Efficiency
Design with future AI in mind: Structure data/tools to integrate seamlessly with new models or hardware (e.g., MacBook Pro port).
- **Data Prep**: Embed metadata (YAML) for easy AI ingestion—e.g., frontmatter enables quick indexing without databases.
- **Compute Considerations**: Prioritize lazy operations on local systems—e.g., parse manifest first, import only needed tools.
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure code runs on Windows (3090) and macOS (Metal)—e.g., use cross-compatible libs, test for ARM.
- **Benefits**: Reduces rework; e.g., tools with metadata are ready for voice modes (like "Her" OS mimic) or community sharing.

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Start Small**: In Phase 3, refactor tool loading for hybrid metadata; test with simple goals to verify savings.
- **Testing**: Use `time python -m src.main` for benchmarks; monitor VRAM with `nvidia-smi` or Activity Monitor.
- **Iteration**: After core stability, add educational layers (e.g., logs explaining AI decisions) for teaching.

## Benefits for Project Alice and Beyond
- **For You**: Efficient on local hardware; scalable for MacBook teaching demos.
- **For Students**: Teaches AI as a tool for problem-solving, with real code examples.
- **For Community**: Open, modular design invites contributions—e.g., share tools with embedded metadata.

This philosophy turns Project Alice into more than an agent—it's a blueprint for AI-driven innovation. Feedback welcome to refine!
